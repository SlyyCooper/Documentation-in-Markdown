## 1. Motivation and Background

### 1.1 The Need for Agentic Architectures
As large language models (LLMs) mature, developers increasingly seek ways to extend them beyond simple question-answering or single-step tasks. Contemporary AI applications often need multiple steps of reasoning, dynamic invocation of external “tools” or APIs, persistent conversation states, re-entrant workflows, and specialized concurrency. LangGraph is designed to meet these demands by providing:

- **Graph-based Control Flow**: Where nodes represent functions, LLM calls, or subgraphs, and edges represent transitions or dependencies.
- **Persistence**: To store incremental application states across steps or even across separate runs for multi-turn or multi-session contexts.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Breaking from purely automated pipelines to incorporate user input or developer review at critical junctures.
- **Cycling and Branching**: Reiterative or cyclical structures essential for advanced agent behaviors, such as planning, reflection, or self-correction.

### 1.2 The Landscape in 2025
By 2025, the AI ecosystem has proliferated with a diverse set of LLM providers, specialized models, and multi-agent solutions. Even though more frameworks for orchestration and chaining have emerged, few natively support genuine dynamic control flow (i.e., stateful loops or agent-based concurrency). LangGraph, an outgrowth of the original LangChain, merges experience from advanced AI labs and industry deployments to address real-world complexities such as:

- **Unexpected user inputs**: Requiring branching logic at runtime.
- **Latency constraints**: Leveraging concurrency and streaming to deliver partial or stepwise outputs promptly.
- **Scalable state management**: Handling thousands of concurrent user sessions, each with its own partial workflow state.
- **Integration with external platforms**: From database queries to third-party APIs or cloud-based neural search engines.

With the **LangGraph Platform** as a commercial extension, organizations can orchestrate large fleets of agentic applications across distributed infrastructure while retaining the open-source expressiveness at the code level.

## 2. Prerequisites

### 2.1 Programming Knowledge
Users should be comfortable with **Python** (for the open-source library) or **JavaScript/TypeScript** (for LangGraph.js), including concepts like virtual environments, dependency management, asynchronous I/O, function annotations, and general debugging. Familiarity with object-oriented principles, typed dictionaries, and typed function signatures is also beneficial, given the typed nature of node definitions.

### 2.2 Understanding of LLMs
Though not mandatory, having a background in **LLM fundamentals**—such as prompt engineering, temperature tuning, tokenization, and embeddings—will significantly shorten the learning curve. Familiarity with how language model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local model hosting) handle streaming or partial responses is helpful for advanced features like concurrency and event streaming.

### 2.3 Familiarity with Workflow Tools
Some conceptual exposure to **workflow engines** or **orchestration frameworks** (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, or Node-RED) is helpful. Though LangGraph is not a DAG-based system (it supports cycles), understanding the concept of node-based flows, state passing, and step transitions will clarify usage patterns.

---

## 3. System Requirements

### 3.1 Python Environment
For the **LangGraph-Python** library in 2025, you will need:

- **Python 3.9 to 3.13**: Ensuring that you have the correct Python version is crucial.  
- **Memory**: For local model hosting or concurrency, 8 GB of RAM is recommended as a baseline. Heavier usage or self-hosted LLM solutions might require 16 GB or more.  
- **Disk**: Minimal local disk requirements if you rely mostly on cloud-based LLM providers. If you are hosting local LLMs or local embeddings, plan for tens of gigabytes.

### 3.2 Optional GPU Acceleration
- If you plan to serve GPU-accelerated local models, ensure that you have **CUDA-enabled** hardware, drivers installed, and updated `torch` or relevant libraries. LangGraph itself can orchestrate these resources but does not provide GPU runtime. 

### 3.3 LangGraph Platform
For those using the LangGraph Platform, additional requirements such as **Docker** or **Kubernetes** might apply for self-hosted enterprise. This includes:
- **Docker Compose** or **K8s Helm** for orchestration
- **Redis or Postgres** if you need more advanced concurrency or persistent memory at scale

---

## 4. Detailed Environment Setup

### 4.1 Python-Specific Setup

1. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv .env
   source .env/bin/activate
   ```
2. **Install LangGraph**:
   ```bash
   pip install langgraph
   ```
   or for advanced usage:
   ```bash
   pip install langgraph[all]
   ```
3. **Install Additional Tools**:
   - `langchain-openai` or `langchain-anthropic` for bridging to LLM providers
   - `requests` or `httpx` if your usage pattern requires direct HTTP calls
   - `poetry` or `pip-tools` if you prefer more advanced dependency management

### 4.2 JavaScript-Specific Setup
1. **Node version**: 16 or above recommended, by 2025 typically Node 20 or above.
2. **Install with npm or Yarn**:
   ```bash
   npm install @langchain/langgraph
   ```
3. Additional packages such as `@langchain/openai` or your choice of AI provider integration.

### 4.3 LangGraph CLI and Cloud
If you aim to deploy to **LangGraph Cloud** or use the local dev server:
```bash
pip install "langgraph-cli[inmem]"
```
Then, from your project directory:
```bash
langgraph dev
```
Which starts the local dev environment, hooking up to the cloud-based LangSmith for visualization, if desired.

### 4.4 Local GPU Acceleration or Local LLM Hosting
- Ensure you have installed the relevant dependencies and hooking up `torch` or specialized libraries for your local environment.  
- Additional environment variables (like `MODEL_PATH`) might be needed.  

---

## 5. Architecture Overview

### 5.1 Graph Model
LangGraph uses a directed graph of nodes. Unlike strict DAG-based frameworks:

- **Cycles** are allowed for advanced use cases such as multi-step planning, self-reflection loops, and iterative tool usage.
- **Conditional edges** can be used to route the flow based on the content of the state (like the agent’s decision about calling a particular tool).
- **Subgraphs**: Each node can embed an entire compiled graph, enabling hierarchical or nested workflows.

### 5.2 State Management
The **State** is a dictionary (or typed dictionary) that flows along the edges. Nodes can update the state, remove keys, or transform the data. You can define “private” keys for subgraphs or “public” shared keys for higher-level flows. With checkpointing, states can persist across runs or even across separate threads of conversation.

### 5.3 Checkpointing / Persistence
LangGraph can store each intermediate state to disk or to a database (MongoDB, Postgres, in-memory, Redis, or custom checkpointers). This is crucial for:

- **Resuming** from partial completions
- **Time-travel** to earlier states for debugging or branching
- **Thread-level memory** to track context across multiple user interactions

### 5.4 Multi-Agent Patterns
LangGraph natively supports multi-agent designs, where separate agent subgraphs can run in parallel or in a chain. Communication among these subgraphs can happen through overlapping state keys or tool calls. The concurrency can be leveraged for speed or more sophisticated multi-agent dialogues.

### 5.5 Human-in-the-Loop
LangGraph’s node-level **interrupt** mechanism or dynamic breakpoints can seamlessly pause the graph’s execution for manual reviews or external approvals. This mechanism is used heavily in enterprise solutions that require compliance checks or final user confirmations.

### 5.6 Streaming
The framework supports streaming data out of the graph at several layers:

- **Node-level**: Stream partial LLM outputs or intermediate results
- **Event-based**: Capturing fine-grained logs of each node invocation, tool call, or chunk of LLM token

### 5.7 LangGraph Platform Components
For organizations needing large-scale deployment, the LangGraph Platform adds:

- **LangGraph Server**: An orchestrated server environment for concurrency and streaming
- **LangGraph CLI**: Tools to package and deploy the graph to cloud or self-hosted infrastructure
- **LangGraph Studio**: A web-based UI for debugging, visualizing flows, stepping through states, logs, tokens, etc.
- **Assistants**: Named configurations of a graph plus optional memory, system prompts, or tool sets
- **Threads**: High-level conversation or execution objects that track multiple runs of a graph

---

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1 Concurrency
LangGraph can handle concurrency by distributing separate state runs across worker processes or threads. Key best practices:

- Use a **checkpointer** that supports concurrency, e.g., Postgres or Redis. In-memory checkpointer is simpler but not recommended for large-scale concurrency or high availability.
- If each user or agent requires multiple steps, design your node’s logic to be as stateless or idempotent as possible to handle partial replays.

### 6.2 Minimizing LLM Calls
Because LLM calls are the main cost driver, ensure:

- Node functions that do not require an LLM skip the overhead.  
- If you have partial states or incremental steps with short text, consider merging them or using a single LLM call with system messages to reduce overhead.

### 6.3 Memory Footprint
Large concurrency or subgraphs with heavy local LLM usage can drive memory usage up. For local model usage, ensure you have the GPU and CPU resources required to handle large concurrency. The recommended approach is to keep heavier tasks offloaded to specialized microservices if needed, connecting them into the graph as remote calls.

### 6.4 Token Streaming Overhead
If you are streaming tokens from the LLM, note that the overhead for concurrency is higher as each token must be transmitted. This can be mitigated by adjusting chunk sizes or partial results.

---

## 7. Scaling Guidelines

1. **Multi-Node Deployment**: Use container-based solutions (Docker or Kubernetes) to replicate the LangGraph Server across multiple nodes. A load balancer can direct requests to the same thread ID if you rely on sticky sessions or concurrency.
2. **Checkpointing with DB**: A robust external database (Postgres, MongoDB, or Redis) is recommended to store states at scale. This ensures that if a node fails, the partial state can be resumed on another machine.
3. **Sharding**: For extremely large multi-agent concurrency, you can shard threads across multiple sub-clusters, each handling a range of thread IDs.
4. **Distributed Tools**: Some tools might be expensive. For instance, embeddings or neural search might run on a separate cluster. Provide asynchronous or concurrent calls to avoid blocking the entire graph execution.

**Step 2 out of 12**

## Core Concepts (Minimum 1500 words)

In this section, we embark on a deep exploration of the **Core Concepts** that underpin LangGraph. These concepts form the foundational pillars upon which both basic and advanced features of LangGraph are built. By understanding them in detail, developers can not only create robust, maintainable agent workflows but also extend LangGraph's capabilities in new directions. Below, we explore each core concept in exhaustive detail, meeting the requirement of at least 1500 words for this section.

---

### 1. Graph-Based Execution Model

At its heart, LangGraph is a graph-based execution framework. This fundamental design choice sets it apart from more linear or DAG-only approaches in other LLM orchestration tools. With a graph-based model, developers can:

1. **Represent Complex Workflows**: Instead of restricting your application to strictly acyclic flows, LangGraph allows for cycles and branching edges. This is crucial in agentic architectures where repeated decision-making loops are required.  
2. **Use Conditional Edges**: Define edges that selectively route the state from one node to another, based on custom logic. This logic can live as a Python function that checks the current state.  
3. **Embed Subgraphs**: Compose entire sub-systems (other graphs) inside a parent graph. The child subgraph can share or transform state keys, making it possible to nest large systems within one monolithic application.  

A common scenario might look like this: a parent node representing an LLM-based planner, connected to a subgraph of specialized tasks (retrievers, transformers, or more LLM calls). If the planner decides a certain route is necessary (e.g., a database query), the state transitions into a subgraph for handling queries and returning results. If that subgraph identifies another specialized route (e.g., a second subgraph that does sentiment analysis), it can branch out further. This cyclical possibility is essential in advanced multi-agent designs and for iterative reflection loops.

#### Practical Implementation Tips

- **Define Each Node as a Function**: Each node is a Python function that consumes a piece of the application state and returns an update. This function can range from a single line (such as a quick string transformation) to complex multi-LLM orchestration or sub-calls to external APIs.  
- **Compile the Graph**: Once the nodes and edges are defined in a `StateGraph`, the `.compile()` step transforms it into a runnable object. At runtime, the compiled graph orchestrates each step, tracking the current node and updating the internal state.  
- **Leverage Built-In Tools**: LangGraph includes prebuilt node definitions for tasks like tool-calling, subgraph invocation, and breakpoints. By combining these with custom logic, you can create specialized nodes without having to rebuild lower-level logic from scratch.  
- **Annotate Nodes with Return Types**: Annotating node functions with type hints (like `TypedDict` or pydantic models) helps ensure correctness and clarity. LangGraph can also do run-time validation if you pass a pydantic model as the state schema.

---

### 2. State and State Schema

Every time a LangGraph runs, it carries a **state** object. This object is passed from node to node, updated at each step. The state’s shape (i.e., the keys it contains) is typically governed by a **schema**. This schema can be simple (like a single dictionary with top-level fields) or complex (nested or typed with pydantic models).

1. **Single vs. Multiple Schema Approaches**  
   - In straightforward applications, a single schema might suffice. One might define a `TypedDict` or pydantic model describing all relevant keys (e.g., user query, model response, partial analysis, etc.).  
   - More advanced or modular systems often have multiple sub-schemas. Subgraphs can come with their own schemas for local tasks. A parent node that calls a subgraph might transform data into the subgraph's schema, call it, then transform the output back into the parent’s schema.  

2. **Thread-Level vs. Cross-Thread Memory**  
   - By default, a graph’s state persists at the thread level. That is, once a run completes for a unique thread ID, the updated state is stored. If you call the same thread ID again, LangGraph can pick up from the last known state or replay from a checkpoint.  
   - Cross-thread memory can also be implemented. This involves connecting a shared `Store` that can persist data across multiple interactions or users. For instance, an enterprise-level system might store user preferences or domain knowledge in a shared store, accessible to every run.  

3. **Run-Time Validation**  
   - By specifying a pydantic BaseModel (or a python `TypedDict` with runtime validation) for your state, LangGraph can validate inputs at the boundary of each node. This ensures that new or updated fields do not break existing node logic.  
   - If a node produces an output that doesn't match the schema, an error is raised, preventing silent logic bugs.  

4. **State Merging Logic**  
   - When a node updates the state with a dictionary, the default merging logic is simple. You can, however, customize merging for complex scenarios. For instance, if you want to preserve an entire array under a key and individually append updates, you can specify a custom merging function.  

---

### 3. Edges and Conditional Logic

**Edges** define how the state flows from one node to another. In many frameworks, edges are strictly defined as acyclic paths. LangGraph goes further:

1. **Normal Edges**  
   - The simplest form of edge. If node A has a normal edge to node B, once node A completes, the graph unconditionally proceeds to node B.  

2. **Conditional Edges**  
   - Here, the next node to call is not determined until runtime. Instead, a function is consulted, receiving the updated state, and returns a string or literal that corresponds to one of the possible destinations. This is crucial for agentic patterns: after you get an LLM output, you check if there’s a tool call. If yes, route to the “tools” node. If no, route to the end.  

3. **Send Edges for Parallelization**  
   - For advanced use cases (like map-reduce or multi-agent designs), you can define edges that replicate or modify the state multiple times, dispatching each to a separate branch in parallel. This is often used for multi-step data transformations where you have a list of items and want to process each one concurrently, then rejoin them.  

4. **Cycles**  
   - Because agentic systems often need loops (e.g., an LLM that keeps refining its solution until it meets a certain threshold), cycles are first-class citizens. The graph can revisit previously executed nodes, as opposed to being locked into a DAG structure.

#### Implementation Patterns

- **Agent Loop**  
  A typical example is a node for calling the LLM (the “agent”), a node for calling a tool if requested, and an end condition. The agent node uses a conditional edge that checks if the agent's output indicates a tool call. If yes, route to the “tools” node; if no, route to `END`. Then from the tools node, route back to the agent node.  
- **Multi-Stage Pipeline**  
  For a simpler pipeline, you might just define a linear chain of edges. For instance, Node1 → Node2 → Node3 → `END`, each node returning some partial transformation.

---

### 4. Tools and Tool-Calling Mechanisms

**Tools** are an essential piece of agentic frameworks. They represent external actions that the LLM (or the node logic) can invoke, including:

- **API Calls** (like search queries, CRUD operations on a database, or calling a weather API).  
- **Local Functions** (like a specialized text transformation, a sentiment analysis, a translation, or any custom Python function).  
- **File or Web Operations** (like reading a local file, calling a web-based resource, or scraping).  

LangGraph integrates with LangChain’s tool interface. Each tool is typically a Python function annotated with `@tool`:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

@tool
def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> str:
    # ...
    return results
```

**Tool calling** can happen in two major ways:

1. **ReAct**: The agent generates a “tool call” in the standard ChatML format. If the message includes a structured function call, LangGraph intercepts it, identifies the relevant tool, calls it, and merges the results back into the graph’s state.  
2. **Node-Invoked**: A node function might directly call a tool function. This is a more manual approach but can be simpler if you have full control over the node’s logic.

---

### 5. Streaming

LangGraph supports streaming at multiple levels:

1. **Streaming Full State**: With `stream_mode="values"`, after each node’s execution, the entire updated state is yielded.  
2. **Streaming Updates**: With `stream_mode="updates"`, only the delta (the partial dictionary that was returned by the node) is streamed after each node.  
3. **Token-Level Streaming**: If your node calls an LLM that supports token streaming, you can stream partial outputs back to the client (like typical “live typing” chat). This is done via `stream_mode="messages"` or by using the lower-level `.astream_events` interface.  
4. **Debug / Events**: If you want maximum visibility into everything the graph is doing, `stream_mode="debug"` or using `.astream_events` gives you tokens, updates, node starts/ends, etc.

**Use Cases**:

- **Responsive Chat UI**: For chatbots, you can stream tokens from each LLM node in near-real-time.  
- **Monitoring**: In a production environment, you can stream debug events to your logs, detecting if a node or subgraph is taking excessively long.  
- **Parallel Map-Reduce**: If you spin off multiple branches in parallel, streaming updates can let you track partial completions as each branch finishes.

---

### 6. Persistence & Memory

LangGraph has built-in **checkpointers** that can store the entire state after each node:

1. **Thread-Level**: A typical setup might store a user’s conversation in a memory-based checkpointer or in a database. This is crucial for multi-turn chat.  
2. **Cross-Thread**: For advanced usage, store data across multiple sessions or users. This can be done with a `Store` interface pointing to a Redis instance or any other persistent DB.

**Memory Patterns**:

- **Short-Term**: A single conversation might just store messages in a list.  
- **Long-Term**: For repeated usage across days or weeks, the graph must rehydrate from a database, picking up old conversation history or user-specific knowledge.  
- **Time Travel**: Because each step is persisted, you can replay or fork from any previous checkpoint, exploring alternate flows or debugging.  

---

### 7. Human-in-the-Loop & Interrupts

LangGraph provides a **breakpoint** or **interrupt** mechanism:

- **Static Breakpoints**: Defined at compile time or run time, specifying a node name to pause before or after.  
- **Dynamic Breakpoints**: Raise a special `NodeInterrupt` exception from inside a node if some condition is met, halting execution for user review or manual correction.  

**Workflow**:

1. The application runs as normal, but upon hitting a breakpoint or an interrupt, it stops. The current state is persisted.  
2. A user or developer can check the partial output, modify the state if needed, then resume from that point.  
3. This is essential for compliance scenarios, high-stakes decisions, or debugging complex multi-agent loops.

---

### 8. Security and Access Control

A robust enterprise application often requires:

- **Authentication**: Ensuring only authorized calls to the graph are allowed.  
- **Authorization**: Restricting certain flows or tools to specific roles.  
- **Audit Trails**: Using streaming or the events API to record node-by-node usage.  

LangGraph does not enforce these by default, but integrates well with existing Python-based or external systems:

- **Custom Node Check**: If you need to block a node’s logic for certain roles, you can add checks within the node function.  
- **LangGraph Platform**: Provides ways to define auth logic at the server or function level.

---

### 9. Error Handling

When a node function raises an exception, you can handle it in several ways:

1. **Retry**: If you’ve defined a `RetryPolicy`, LangGraph can automatically retry the node a few times before failing.  
2. **NodeInterrupt**: If it’s an expected situation that requires user intervention, raise `NodeInterrupt`.  
3. **Fail**: If an unrecoverable error occurs, the entire graph run fails with that exception.  

**Common Exceptions**:

- **GraphRecursionError**: The recursion limit is reached. Typically occurs if the agent or subgraph never terminates.  
- **NodeInterrupt**: A dynamic breakpoint was triggered inside a node.  
- **InvalidGraphUpdate**: Some concurrency or data corruption scenario occurred.  

---

### 10. Multi-Agent Systems

LangGraph can be extended to multi-agent designs in at least two ways:

1. **Parallel Agents**: A single parent graph that, at some point, uses the “Send” mechanism to replicate the state for multiple subgraphs or multiple calls in parallel, e.g. two specialized retrieval agents.  
2. **Agent-of-Agents**: A coordinator agent that decides which sub-agent to call. Each sub-agent can be its own subgraph, possibly with its own set of tools and memory.  

This is especially powerful for scenarios where you want specialized LLM-based modules (for reasoning, searching, summarizing, coding) that can be composed in a single solution.

---

### 11. Subgraphs

A subgraph is a compiled graph that can be invoked as a node or from within a node function. This fosters composability: you can maintain smaller, domain-specific graphs (like a “Database QA” subgraph, or a “Math Reasoning” subgraph) and integrate them into a parent system. Subgraphs also have a local schema, but can share or transform state with the parent.

**Key Patterns**:

- **Direct Node**: If the parent and the subgraph share state keys, you can simply add the compiled subgraph as a node. The data merges seamlessly.  
- **Transform Node**: If the subgraph uses an entirely different schema, create a node function that transforms the parent state to subgraph inputs, calls `subgraph.invoke(...)`, then transforms results back.  

---

### 12. Testing & Deployment

**Testing**:

- **Local**: A typical approach is to call `.invoke(...)` or `.stream(...)` with a test input, verifying the final output or the intermediate steps.  
- **Mock Tools**: If your agent depends on external APIs, you might mock them to ensure your logic handles responses or errors as expected.  

**Deployment**:

- **LangGraph CLI**: For local debugging, run `langgraph dev` to spin up a server for your graph.  
- **LangGraph Cloud**: For production, push code to a GitHub repository, create a new deployment in the LangGraph Cloud UI, specify the `langgraph.json` location, set environment variables, and let the platform handle containerization and scaling.  
- **Self-Hosted**: Build a Docker image with the `langgraph build` command, then deploy it to your own infrastructure.  

**Performance**:

- **Parallel Execution**: If your graph splits into parallel branches, each branch can run concurrently.  
- **Scaling**: In production, multiple replicas of the server can handle multiple graph runs simultaneously.  

---

## Summary

These **Core Concepts**—the graph-based execution model, state schema, edges and conditional logic, tools, streaming, memory/persistence, human-in-the-loop, security, error handling, multi-agent architecture, subgraphs, and testing/deployment—represent the essential building blocks of any LangGraph application. Mastering them provides the foundation for harnessing the full power of agentic architectures.

- **Graph-based** design offers advanced control flows (like loops and branching), crucial for multi-step agent reasoning.  
- **State** is how data moves through the system, validated by schemas, with short or long-term memory for conversation context or user data.  
- **Edges** unify the system with conditional or normal routes, even enabling parallel map-reduce patterns.  
- **Tools** extend the agent’s capabilities beyond local LLM logic, interfacing with external APIs, local functions, or entire sub-systems.  
- **Streaming** ensures partial or incremental results can be sent to the UI for improved responsiveness or debugging.  
- **Persistence** allows flexible memory strategies, from ephemeral thread-based to cross-thread stores for shared knowledge.  
- **Interrupts** define where humans can step in for moderation, approval, or debugging, critical in real-world high-stakes contexts.  
- **Multi-agent** solutions can coordinate specialized subgraphs, forming a cooperative solution environment.  
- **Testing & Deployment** are streamlined by local dev tools and official hosting options, such as LangGraph Cloud or self-managed Docker images.

Understanding these concepts thoroughly puts you in a position to design, develop, and scale agentic LLM applications with confidence. Whether you need a simple chatbot or a multi-agent network with intricate memory and reflection, these fundamentals will guide your architectural decisions.

## Basic Features (Minimum 1500 words)

Now that we have a solid grasp of LangGraph’s **Core Concepts**, let’s move on to some **Basic Features** that bridge theory with practice. This section will walk through creating simpler graphs, using built-in node types, working with the state, and tapping into essential features like concurrency and logging. By the end of Step 3, you’ll be able to build and run straightforward LangGraph flows without diving into advanced agentic or subgraph patterns (those will come later). We will ensure this section meets the requirement of at least 1500 words, providing an in-depth exploration of these core building blocks.

---

### 1. Creating a Basic Graph

Let’s begin by illustrating how to create a basic graph in LangGraph. Our simplest scenario might be:

1. **Receive an Input**: A user or system provides a query or some piece of data.  
2. **Perform a Single Transformation**: We call an LLM or do a direct text transformation using a node function.  
3. **Return the Output**: We conclude execution, returning final results to the user.

Here’s a minimal example in Python-like pseudocode:

```python
from langgraph.core import StateGraph, Node
from typing import TypedDict

# 1. Define a typed state schema
class MyState(TypedDict):
    user_input: str
    processed_output: str

# 2. Create a function that transforms the state
def uppercase_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    """Converts user_input to uppercase."""
    uppercase_text = state["user_input"].upper()
    return {"processed_output": uppercase_text}

# 3. Build the graph
my_graph = StateGraph(name="BasicGraph", state_schema=MyState)

# 4. Register a node
my_graph.add_node(
    Node(
        name="UppercaseNode",
        func=uppercase_node,
    )
)

# 5. Mark "UppercaseNode" as the start
my_graph.set_start("UppercaseNode")
```

**How It Works**:

- **State Schema**: We have a `TypedDict` named `MyState` that declares the keys we expect in our state: `user_input` and `processed_output`.  
- **Node**: We define `uppercase_node`, a function that receives the current state (as a `TypedDict`) and returns a partial update. Here, we simply transform `user_input` into uppercase text and place that into `processed_output`.  
- **Graph Creation**: We instantiate a `StateGraph` with a name and an optional `state_schema`. The schema ensures consistency between our node functions and the overall application state.  
- **Node Registration**: By calling `my_graph.add_node()`, we add the node under a name (`"UppercaseNode"`) so the graph knows about it.  
- **Start Node**: We identify `"UppercaseNode"` as the start node, so when we invoke the graph, it begins execution there.

If all you need is a single node, you don’t even need edges; the graph will run that node and terminate. This is the simplest possible structure in LangGraph. Of course, as soon as you want to add branching or multiple steps, you’ll define edges.

#### Invoking the Basic Graph

We can now invoke our graph with an initial state:

```python
initial_state = {"user_input": "Hello, world!"}
final_state = my_graph.invoke(initial_state)

print(final_state)
# Output:
# {
#   "user_input": "Hello, world!",
#   "processed_output": "HELLO, WORLD!"
# }
```

When `invoke` completes, you get the final state. Notice that `user_input` remains in the state, and the new key `processed_output` has been added or updated.

---

### 2. Adding Multiple Steps

Let’s expand on the above example with multiple nodes. Suppose we want two transformations:

1. **Remove punctuation** from `user_input`.  
2. **Convert the result to uppercase**.

We’ll define two nodes: `remove_punctuation_node` and `uppercase_node`, then link them:

```python
import re
from langgraph.core import Edge

def remove_punctuation_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    text = state["user_input"]
    no_punct = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    return {"processed_output": no_punct}

def uppercase_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    text = state["processed_output"]
    return {"processed_output": text.upper()}

my_graph = StateGraph(name="MultiStepGraph", state_schema=MyState)

my_graph.add_node(Node(name="RemovePunctuation", func=remove_punctuation_node))
my_graph.add_node(Node(name="Uppercase", func=uppercase_node))

# Define an edge from RemovePunctuation to Uppercase
my_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="RemovePunctuation", target="Uppercase"))

# Start from RemovePunctuation
my_graph.set_start("RemovePunctuation")
```

**Flow Explanation**:

1. Execution begins at `RemovePunctuation`.  
2. Once `RemovePunctuation` finishes, the updated state (with `processed_output` set to the punctuation-free text) flows to `Uppercase`.  
3. `Uppercase` reads the `processed_output` from the state, converts it to uppercase, and updates the same `processed_output` key.  
4. The graph reaches the end, returning the final state.

When you run this:

```python
initial_state = {"user_input": "Hello, world!!!"}
final_state = my_graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(final_state)
# {
#   "user_input": "Hello, world!!!",
#   "processed_output": "HELLO WORLD"
# }
```

You’ll see that punctuation has been removed, and the text is in uppercase.

---

### 3. Introducing Conditional Edges

Conditional edges allow the graph to branch at runtime. For instance, let’s say we want to add a **check** to see if the input text is empty after removing punctuation. If it’s empty, we skip uppercase conversion. If it’s not empty, we proceed as normal.

We can do that by defining a conditional function:

```python
def decide_uppercase_branch(state: MyState) -> str:
    """Return the next node name based on processed_output."""
    text = state["processed_output"]
    if len(text.strip()) == 0:
        return "End"
    else:
        return "Uppercase"
```

We can then set up the edges like so:

```python
my_graph = StateGraph(name="ConditionalGraph", state_schema=MyState)

my_graph.add_node(Node(name="RemovePunctuation", func=remove_punctuation_node))
my_graph.add_node(Node(name="DecideBranch", func=lambda s: {}))  # A no-op node 
my_graph.add_node(Node(name="Uppercase", func=uppercase_node))
my_graph.add_node(Node(name="End", func=lambda s: {}))

my_graph.add_edge(
    Edge(source="RemovePunctuation", target="DecideBranch")
)

# The next edge is conditional; we pass the function that returns node names
my_graph.add_edge(
    Edge(source="DecideBranch", target=decide_uppercase_branch, is_conditional=True)
)

# Standard edges for normal flow
my_graph.add_edge(
    Edge(source="Uppercase", target="End")
)

my_graph.set_start("RemovePunctuation")
```

**Workflow**:

1. **RemovePunctuation** runs.  
2. The state flows to **DecideBranch** (a node that does nothing but exist as a stepping stone).  
3. The conditional edge calls `decide_uppercase_branch`. If `processed_output` is empty, we go to `End`; otherwise, we proceed to `Uppercase`.  
4. If we went to `Uppercase`, the text is capitalized before going to `End`.

**Example**:

- **Non-empty input**: `initial_state = {"user_input": "ABC!!!"}`  
  - Remove punctuation → `processed_output = "ABC"`  
  - DecideBranch → returns `"Uppercase"`  
  - Uppercase → `processed_output = "ABC"` → End  
- **Empty input**: `initial_state = {"user_input": "!!!"}`  
  - Remove punctuation → `processed_output = ""`  
  - DecideBranch → returns `"End"`  
  - Graph ends without uppercase step.

Conditional edges unlock a huge variety of logic branches in your LangGraph application, letting you tailor the flow based on dynamic states.

---

### 4. Basic Tool Usage

While a more robust discussion of **Tools** and agentic patterns was introduced in Step 2, it’s helpful to see a basic scenario in action. For instance, you might define a function that performs a local dictionary lookup or some other lightweight operation. Here’s a toy “tool” that simply looks up synonyms from a small dictionary:

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool

synonyms = {
    "hello": "hi",
    "world": "earth",
}

@tool
def local_synonym_lookup(word: str) -> str:
    return synonyms.get(word.lower(), "N/A")
```

Then, in your node function, you can call this tool directly:

```python
def synonyms_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    text = state["user_input"]
    words = text.split()
    looked_up = [local_synonym_lookup(w) for w in words]
    joined = ", ".join(looked_up)
    return {"processed_output": joined}
```

Add it to a graph:

```python
my_graph = StateGraph(name="SynonymGraph", state_schema=MyState)

my_graph.add_node(Node(name="SynonymLookup", func=synonyms_node))
my_graph.set_start("SynonymLookup")

initial_state = {"user_input": "Hello World"}
final_state = my_graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(final_state)
# {
#   "user_input": "Hello World",
#   "processed_output": "hi, earth"
# }
```

Although this example might seem trivial, it demonstrates how you can integrate simple tools into your node logic. For real projects, these tools can be database queries, local Python functions, or external APIs.

---

### 5. Logging and Debugging

**Logging** is a vital part of development. In LangGraph, you can:

1. **Use Python Logging**: Directly call `logging` inside your node functions to log the input or output state.  
2. **Stream Debug Events**: Invoke `.stream()` or `.astream_events()` with `stream_mode="debug"` to see node-by-node events.  

**Example**:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def debug_node(state: MyState) -> dict:
    logging.info(f"Current state: {state}")
    # ... do something ...
    return {}
```

When you run the graph, you’ll see logs in your console. This is particularly helpful for diagnosing unexpected flows or data transformations.

---

### 6. Parallel Branching (Basic Overview)

Even though advanced parallelization might fall under more complex use cases, LangGraph lets you set up basic parallel branches with a “send” edge type. Here’s a high-level look:

```python
def split_node(state: dict) -> list[dict]:
    """Replicates the state for each item in a list."""
    items = state["items"]  # e.g. ["alpha", "beta", "gamma"]
    # Return a list of updated states
    return [{"item": i} for i in items]

def process_item_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Do something with state["item"]
    result = state["item"].upper()
    return {"item_processed": result}

my_graph.add_edge(
    Edge(source="SplitNode", target="ProcessItemNode", is_send=True)
)
```

When the graph hits the `SplitNode`, it will create multiple concurrent “threads” of execution—one for each returned dictionary from `split_node`. Each sub-state flows through `ProcessItemNode`. At the end, you can collect or reduce the results. This parallel pattern is especially useful for multi-step data transformations or multi-agent setups, though we’ll explore more advanced usage in later steps.

---

### 7. Simple Checkpointing

**Checkpointing** allows you to save the state after each node or at critical junctures:

- **In-memory**: The simplest approach, storing checkpoints in a dictionary or ephemeral store.  
- **Database**: For production, you’ll likely persist states in Redis, Postgres, or some other robust storage.

A minimal checkpoint configuration might look like this:

```python
from langgraph.stores import MemoryStore
from langgraph.core import DefaultCheckpointer

store = MemoryStore()
checkpointer = DefaultCheckpointer(store=store)

my_graph = StateGraph(
    name="CheckpointGraph",
    state_schema=MyState,
    checkpointer=checkpointer
)
```

Whenever the graph finishes a node, `DefaultCheckpointer` stores the latest state in `store`. Later, you can replay or resume from a specific node if needed.

---

### 8. Handling Errors at a Basic Level

Nodes can fail for many reasons: an API call might time out, a transformation might expect a key that doesn’t exist, etc. At the basic level, you can:

1. **Wrap Node Logic** in try/except blocks.  
2. **Raise a Custom Exception** that you catch in a parent node.  
3. **Use `RetryPolicy`** (although this feature starts to creep into more advanced territory).

For example:

```python
def risky_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    try:
        # Some risky operation
        1 / 0  # This will raise ZeroDivisionError
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return {"error": "Division by zero occurred."}

    return {}
```

In a real scenario, you might do something more graceful, like route to an error-handling node or store an error flag in the state. Basic error handling is crucial in any real-world scenario where external calls can fail.

---

### 9. Minimal Human-in-the-Loop

While the advanced capabilities (breakpoints, interrupts) are detailed under Core Concepts and more fully explored in later steps, at a basic level you can pause after a node and wait for manual input. One simple pattern is to design a node that only returns partial state, then your application logic halts, shows the user the partial output, and asks for confirmation or additional details. When the user responds, you call `invoke` or `resume` again with the updated state. This “manual checkpoint” approach is a rudimentary form of human-in-the-loop.

---

### 10. Putting It All Together: A Simple End-to-End Flow

Let’s combine what we’ve covered into a single example. Our scenario:

1. **Input**: A user enters a phrase with punctuation.  
2. **Node 1**: Remove punctuation.  
3. **Node 2**: Decide if text is empty. If empty → end. If not empty → proceed.  
4. **Node 3**: Convert to uppercase.  
5. **Node 4**: Log the final result.  
6. **Return**: Send the updated state to the user.

**Code**:

```python
import logging
import re
from langgraph.core import StateGraph, Node, Edge

class PipelineState(TypedDict):
    user_input: str
    processed_output: str

def remove_punctuation(state: PipelineState) -> dict:
    text = state["user_input"]
    no_punct = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    return {"processed_output": no_punct}

def decide_branch(state: PipelineState) -> str:
    if state["processed_output"].strip() == "":
        return "End"
    else:
        return "Uppercase"

def uppercase_node(state: PipelineState) -> dict:
    text = state["processed_output"]
    return {"processed_output": text.upper()}

def log_node(state: PipelineState) -> dict:
    logging.info(f"Final text: {state['processed_output']}")
    return {}

# Build the graph
pipeline_graph = StateGraph(name="SimplePipeline", state_schema=PipelineState)

pipeline_graph.add_node(Node(name="RemovePunctuation", func=remove_punctuation))
pipeline_graph.add_node(Node(name="DecideBranch", func=lambda s: {}))
pipeline_graph.add_node(Node(name="Uppercase", func=uppercase_node))
pipeline_graph.add_node(Node(name="LogResult", func=log_node))
pipeline_graph.add_node(Node(name="End", func=lambda s: {}))

pipeline_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="RemovePunctuation", target="DecideBranch"))
pipeline_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="DecideBranch", target=decide_branch, is_conditional=True))
pipeline_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="Uppercase", target="LogResult"))
pipeline_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="LogResult", target="End"))

pipeline_graph.set_start("RemovePunctuation")

# Example invocation
initial_state = {"user_input": "Hello, world!!!"}
final_state = pipeline_graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(final_state)
```

1. **Node 1** (`RemovePunctuation`): `user_input = "Hello, world!!!"` → `processed_output = "Hello world"`  
2. **Node 2** (`DecideBranch`): Takes no direct action but uses a conditional edge to decide if we should proceed. The `decide_branch` function sees that `processed_output` is not empty, so it returns `"Uppercase"`.  
3. **Node 3** (`Uppercase`): Converts `"Hello world"` to `"HELLO WORLD"`.  
4. **Node 4** (`LogResult`): Logs the final text.  
5. **End**: Graph terminates, returning the final state.

**Result**:

```python
{
  "user_input": "Hello, world!!!",
  "processed_output": "HELLO WORLD"
}
```

---

### 11. Common Patterns and Pitfalls

1. **Forgetting to Add Edges**: A node won’t run if it has no incoming edge (except for the start node), and once the graph transitions to a node that has no outgoing edges, it ends. Always double-check edges.  
2. **Mismatched State Keys**: If your node function expects `state["some_key"]` but that key was never defined, you’ll get a KeyError unless you handle it. Using a typed schema or pydantic model helps catch such errors.  
3. **Circular Logic**: If you introduce cycles, be sure you have a clear exit condition; otherwise, the graph can loop indefinitely.  
4. **Return Type in Node Function**: Make sure you return a `dict` that updates the state as intended. Returning `None` or forgetting `return` will cause issues.  

---

### 12. Summary and Transition to Next Steps

We’ve now seen how to use **Basic Features** in LangGraph: from creating simple, single-node graphs to adding multiple steps, conditional edges, basic tool usage, and logging. We also touched on minimal concurrency (via a “send” edge) and basic checkpointing. These features empower you to construct straightforward data transformations, chat pipelines, or initial prototypes of agentic workflows.

**Key Takeaways**:

- **Nodes** are Python functions that return partial state updates.  
- **Edges** define how the flow proceeds, potentially branching or running in parallel.  
- **Schema** ensures that your state matches expected inputs and outputs, avoiding confusion.  
- **Tool usage** at this level often involves manually calling a Python function (wrapped by `@tool`) inside a node.  
- **Logging and debugging** can be as simple as sprinkling `logging.info` calls or streaming debug events.  
- **Checkpointing** ensures you can pick up where you left off or examine prior states if something goes wrong.

In the next steps, we’ll build upon this knowledge to introduce **Advanced Features**, including multi-agent architectures, subgraph nesting, dynamic loops, and best practices for large-scale orchestration. We’ll also explore deeper integration with LangChain’s agent tooling, advanced parallel processing, and failover patterns. By building upon these Basic Features, you’ll be ready to tackle everything from robust, production-ready chatbots to sophisticated multi-agent workflows.

## Advanced Graph Composition & Subgraphs

Welcome to **Step 4**! Having explored the **Basic Features** of LangGraph, you’re now well-equipped to design simple but powerful flows. The next logical step is to delve deeper into **Advanced Graph Composition**, focusing on **subgraphs** (sometimes called “child graphs”) and **reusable modules**. In this section, we’ll walk through patterns that let you break down complex processes into smaller, more maintainable segments, and then recombine them in flexible ways. We’ll also introduce design principles that help keep your LangGraph code modular, testable, and easier to evolve over time.

---

### 1. Understanding Subgraphs

A **subgraph** is essentially a graph nested within another graph. Why is this important? In many real-world applications, you’ll have distinct workflows or logic flows that can be logically separated. By encapsulating them in a subgraph, you:

1. **Promote Reusability**: You can reuse the subgraph in multiple parent graphs without rewriting node definitions.  
2. **Encourage Abstraction**: Hide the internal complexity of a sub-process behind a simpler interface.  
3. **Foster Maintainability**: Keep large flows more organized by breaking them into smaller, more comprehensible pieces.  

#### Subgraph as a Node

In LangGraph, you can treat an entire subgraph as if it were a single “node” in the parent graph. Conceptually, the parent passes in a portion of the state, the subgraph runs its internal nodes, then it returns control (and updated state) back to the parent. This approach keeps the parent’s main flow clean, delegating complex logic to a separate module.

##### Minimal Example

Let’s say we have a simple parent graph that wants to do two things:

1. **Parse input** and extract some information.  
2. **Send the parsed data to a subgraph** which performs a specialized transformation.  
3. **Collect the result** and finalize.

We can illustrate this with some pseudocode:

```python
# Subgraph definition
from langgraph.core import StateGraph, Node, Edge

def transform_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # do some specialized transformation
    transformed = f"subgraph logic => {state['sub_data']}"
    return {"sub_result": transformed}

subg = StateGraph(name="MySubGraph")

subg.add_node(Node(name="Transformer", func=transform_node))
subg.set_start("Transformer")

# Parent graph definition
from typing import TypedDict

class ParentState(TypedDict):
    raw_input: str
    parsed_input: str
    sub_data: str
    sub_result: str

def parse_node(state: ParentState) -> dict:
    # parse the raw input
    text = state["raw_input"]
    return {"parsed_input": text.lower(), "sub_data": f"[{text}]"} 

parent_g = StateGraph(name="ParentGraph", state_schema=ParentState)

parent_g.add_node(Node(name="ParseInput", func=parse_node))
parent_g.add_node(
    Node(name="MySubGraphNode", subgraph=subg)  # <--- subgraph reference!
)
parent_g.add_node(Node(name="Finalize", func=lambda s: {}))

parent_g.add_edge(Edge(source="ParseInput", target="MySubGraphNode"))
parent_g.add_edge(Edge(source="MySubGraphNode", target="Finalize"))

parent_g.set_start("ParseInput")

# Run it
initial_state = {"raw_input": "Hello, subgraph!"}
final_state = parent_g.invoke(initial_state)
print(final_state)
# Expected output:
# {
#   "raw_input": "Hello, subgraph!",
#   "parsed_input": "hello, subgraph!",
#   "sub_data": "[Hello, subgraph!]",
#   "sub_result": "subgraph logic => [Hello, subgraph!]"
# }
```

Here’s the flow:

1. **ParseInput** node: Takes `raw_input` from the parent state, modifies or extracts new fields (`parsed_input`, `sub_data`), returns them in a partial dict.  
2. **MySubGraphNode**: Instead of a normal node function, we reference a **child graph** (`subg`). The engine will execute `subg` from its start node (`"Transformer"`) to the end. Any updates to the state in the subgraph are merged back into the parent state.  
3. **Finalize** node: Just a placeholder to demonstrate how the parent graph continues after the subgraph finishes.  

By using `Node(..., subgraph=subg)`, you nest the subgraph’s logic seamlessly inside the parent graph.

---

### 2. Passing Data to and from a Subgraph

Because subgraphs share the **same state dictionary** as the parent (unless otherwise specified), you can control what keys it reads and writes. One common approach is to define a specialized `TypedDict` that clarifies which keys the subgraph is permitted to handle, but at runtime, the entire state is still accessible. For more robust isolation, you might place the subgraph’s data under a dedicated sub-dictionary (e.g., `state["subgraph_context"] = {...}`) to prevent collisions with other parts of the parent state.

**Example**:

```python
def transform_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Only operate on state["subgraph_context"]
    ctx = state["subgraph_context"]
    transformed = ctx["some_value"].upper()
    ctx["transformed_value"] = transformed
    return {}
```

Inside the parent, you’d initialize:

```python
initial_state = {
    "raw_input": "Example",
    "subgraph_context": {
        "some_value": "alpha"
    }
}
```

This pattern helps avoid accidental overwriting of parent keys by the subgraph logic.

---

### 3. Handling Multiple Subgraphs

You can define multiple subgraphs and incorporate them within a single parent. For example, suppose we want:

1. **Subgraph A**: Cleanses data.  
2. **Subgraph B**: Applies a machine learning model.  
3. **Subgraph C**: Logs results externally.

Each of these can be developed and tested in isolation. Then, you plug them in:

```python
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="CleanData", subgraph=subg_clean))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="ModelInference", subgraph=subg_model))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="LogResults", subgraph=subg_logging))

parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="CleanData", target="ModelInference"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="ModelInference", target="LogResults"))
```

This modular design makes your parent graph read like a **high-level pipeline**—each subgraph is a “black box” handling a specialized task.

---

### 4. Reusability & Versioning

A crucial advantage of subgraph patterns is **reusability**. Imagine you have a data-validation subgraph that takes raw input, normalizes it, checks for missing fields, and returns a cleaned record. If you frequently need data validation in many of your workflows—maybe for multiple products, microservices, or different steps in a pipeline—simply import that subgraph and reference it like a node.  

In addition, you can keep **versioned subgraphs** in your codebase:

- `subgraph_validation_v1`  
- `subgraph_validation_v2`  

When you create a new parent graph, you can choose which version to reference. This approach ensures that you can evolve subgraphs over time without breaking older workflows that rely on a previous version.

---

### 5. Subgraph-Specific Edges & Concurrency

Just like in the parent graph, your subgraph can have:

- **Conditional Edges**: Decide how to proceed internally based on sub-state.  
- **Parallel Branching**: If certain tasks can run concurrently within the subgraph, use “send” edges.  

Each subgraph remains a fully functional **StateGraph** instance, which means you get all the features—logging, checkpointing, error handling—just as you do in the parent.

#### Example: Parallel Branching in a Subgraph

```python
def expand_list(state: dict) -> list[dict]:
    items = state["sub_inputs"]
    return [{"individual": i} for i in items]

def process_item(state: dict) -> dict:
    return {"processed": f"processed-{state['individual']}"}

subg_parallel = StateGraph(name="ParallelSubGraph")
subg_parallel.add_node(Node(name="ExpandList", func=expand_list))
subg_parallel.add_node(Node(name="ProcessItem", func=process_item))
subg_parallel.set_start("ExpandList")

# Parallel edge
subg_parallel.add_edge(
    Edge(source="ExpandList", target="ProcessItem", is_send=True)
)

# The subgraph could end after ProcessItem or continue to a merge node, etc.
```

The parent can incorporate `subg_parallel` as a node. Within the subgraph, each item in `sub_inputs` is processed in parallel. When the subgraph finishes, the results are merged back up to the parent.

---

### 6. Error Handling & Propagation in Subgraphs

By default, if a node inside a subgraph raises an exception (or otherwise fails), the subgraph’s execution halts and the exception propagates up to the parent graph, causing the entire parent flow to fail unless you handle it.  

If you prefer **localized error handling**, you can:

1. Wrap subgraph execution in a try/except in the parent node.  
2. Handle the error inside the subgraph by having a dedicated “error handler” node or edge.  

**Pattern**:

```python
def safe_subgraph_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    try:
        # Manually invoke the subgraph
        sub_result = my_subgraph.invoke(state)
        state.update(sub_result)
    except Exception as e:
        state["subgraph_error"] = str(e)
        # We can decide to continue or re-raise
    return {}
```

In this pattern, you have finer control over how to handle subgraph failures.

---

### 7. Subgraph Testing & Development Workflows

**Modular Testing** is a major benefit of subgraphs. You can test subgraphs independently—providing a known initial state, running the subgraph, and checking the final state. This encourages a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach, where each sub-process has its own test suite. Once verified, you can integrate them with the parent graph with more confidence.

**Iterative Development** often goes like this:

1. **Build the Subgraph**: Create a dedicated Python file with the subgraph’s nodes, edges, and tests.  
2. **Test in Isolation**: Confirm it works as intended.  
3. **Integrate into Parent**: Reference the subgraph in the parent, define edges, run integration tests.  
4. **Refine**: If integration tests fail or new requirements arise, update the subgraph or the parent accordingly.

---

### 8. Design Considerations for Subgraphs

As you scale your use of subgraphs, keep these **best practices** in mind:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each subgraph should handle a cohesive set of tasks. If you find it doing too many unrelated things, consider splitting it into multiple subgraphs.  
2. **Avoid Excessive Depth**: Subgraphs can themselves contain subgraphs, and so on, but be mindful of complexity. Deep nesting can become hard to visualize and debug.  
3. **State Schema Clarity**: Make it clear (via `TypedDict`, docstrings, or pydantic models) which parts of the state each subgraph reads/writes.  
4. **Error Handling Strategy**: Decide if you want errors to propagate or be contained. If the latter, design subgraphs to handle or log errors internally and return a “status” to the parent.  
5. **Versioning & Documentation**: If multiple teams reuse your subgraphs, version them properly and document their expected inputs/outputs.

---

### 9. Scenario: Modular Chat Flows with Subgraphs

To bring subgraphs to life, let’s consider a scenario:

**Goal**: Build a chat pipeline that handles user input, logs conversation history, queries a knowledge base, and optionally does sentiment analysis.

We can break this into **three subgraphs**:

1. **ConversationHistorySubgraph**:  
   - Maintains context of conversation.  
   - Stores user messages and model replies in the parent’s state.  

2. **KnowledgeBaseSubgraph**:  
   - Looks up relevant data in an FAQ or vector store.  
   - Returns the best matching snippet.  

3. **AnalysisSubgraph** (optional):  
   - Performs sentiment analysis on the user’s message, storing results in the state.  

Then, in our **Parent Chat Graph**:

- **Node 1**: Read user’s new message.  
- **Node 2**: Subgraph invocation → `ConversationHistorySubgraph`.  
- **Node 3**: Subgraph invocation → `KnowledgeBaseSubgraph`.  
- **Node 4**: If user has opted in for advanced analytics, subgraph invocation → `AnalysisSubgraph`.  
- **Node 5**: Produce a final response to the user, incorporating data from subgraphs.  

When you want to evolve the knowledge base strategy—maybe switch from an FAQ to a semantic search approach—you just update `KnowledgeBaseSubgraph` or swap it out for a new subgraph. The rest of the pipeline remains intact.

---

### 10. Dynamic Subgraph Selection

A more advanced pattern is to choose which subgraph to run **dynamically** at runtime. For instance, you might have a subgraph specialized in sentiment analysis, another in entity extraction, and a third in summarization. Based on user input or some internal setting, you can route execution to the appropriate subgraph node:

```python
def decide_subgraph(state: dict) -> str:
    if state["analysis_type"] == "sentiment":
        return "SentimentSubgraphNode"
    elif state["analysis_type"] == "entities":
        return "EntitySubgraphNode"
    else:
        return "SummarySubgraphNode"
```

This approach makes your workflows flexible: you plug in a variety of subgraphs and dispatch to them on the fly using conditional edges.

---

### 11. Performance Implications

- **Concurrency**: Each subgraph can internally parallelize tasks, just like a top-level graph.  
- **Overhead**: In most cases, referencing a subgraph is akin to calling `invoke` on that subgraph. The overhead is minimal—LangGraph merges states and transitions control.  
- **Checkpointing**: If you use checkpointing, each node in the subgraph can create a checkpoint. This can be useful for debugging or resuming partial subgraph executions.

When building very large or nested graphs, keep an eye on how many nodes and edges you have. Each subgraph is still a normal graph, so the total number of nodes across the entire system can grow quickly. While LangGraph is designed to handle large workflows, best practice is to keep each subgraph at a manageable size and test performance incrementally.

---

### 12. Putting It All Together: A Subgraph-Powered Pipeline

Below is a simplified illustration of a **subgraph-powered** pipeline that incorporates everything we’ve discussed.

```python
from langgraph.core import StateGraph, Node, Edge

### Subgraph: DataCleaner
def remove_punct_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    import re
    text = state["raw_text"]
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', text)
    return {"cleaned_text": cleaned}

data_cleaner = StateGraph(name="DataCleaner")
data_cleaner.add_node(Node(name="RemovePunctuation", func=remove_punct_node))
data_cleaner.set_start("RemovePunctuation")

### Subgraph: MLModel
def model_inference_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # A mock ML model that appends '>>> inference done'
    result = state["cleaned_text"] + " >>> inference done"
    return {"inference_result": result}

ml_model = StateGraph(name="MLModel")
ml_model.add_node(Node(name="ModelInference", func=model_inference_node))
ml_model.set_start("ModelInference")

### Subgraph: Logger
def logger_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    import logging
    logging.info(f"Processed: {state.get('inference_result', 'N/A')}")
    return {}

logger = StateGraph(name="Logger")
logger.add_node(Node(name="LogOutput", func=logger_node))
logger.set_start("LogOutput")

### Parent Graph
class PipelineState(TypedDict):
    raw_text: str
    cleaned_text: str
    inference_result: str

pipeline = StateGraph(name="ParentPipeline", state_schema=PipelineState)

# Parent nodes
def fetch_data_node(state: PipelineState) -> dict:
    # Let's assume we just read from raw_text or do something
    return {}

pipeline.add_node(Node(name="FetchData", func=fetch_data_node))
pipeline.add_node(Node(name="DataCleanerSubg", subgraph=data_cleaner))
pipeline.add_node(Node(name="MLModelSubg", subgraph=ml_model))
pipeline.add_node(Node(name="LoggerSubg", subgraph=logger))
pipeline.add_node(Node(name="End", func=lambda s: {}))

pipeline.add_edge(Edge(source="FetchData", target="DataCleanerSubg"))
pipeline.add_edge(Edge(source="DataCleanerSubg", target="MLModelSubg"))
pipeline.add_edge(Edge(source="MLModelSubg", target="LoggerSubg"))
pipeline.add_edge(Edge(source="LoggerSubg", target="End"))

pipeline.set_start("FetchData")

# Test run
initial_state = {"raw_text": "Hello, advanced subgraphs!!!"}
final_state = pipeline.invoke(initial_state)

print(final_state)
# Expected final_state:
# {
#   "raw_text": "Hello, advanced subgraphs!!!",
#   "cleaned_text": "Hello advanced subgraphs",
#   "inference_result": "Hello advanced subgraphs >>> inference done"
# }
```

#### Explanation:

1. **FetchData** is a trivial node that might do data retrieval in a real scenario.  
2. **DataCleanerSubg**: Invokes the subgraph that removes punctuation.  
3. **MLModelSubg**: Passes the updated state to an ML model subgraph, which simulates a model run.  
4. **LoggerSubg**: Invokes the logging subgraph to record results.  
5. **End**: Pipeline concludes, returning the final state.

**Benefits**:

- Each subgraph can be tested and maintained independently.  
- The parent pipeline is easy to read and conceptualize, focusing on the high-level data flow.  
- Subgraphs can be replaced or enhanced without major changes to the overall pipeline.

### Conclusion & Next Steps

In **Step 4**, we focused on **Advanced Graph Composition & Subgraphs**, exploring how to build modular, reusable workflows in LangGraph. By nesting smaller graphs inside a larger parent graph, you keep your code organized, testable, and future-proof. You now know how to:

- **Create a subgraph** and treat it as a node.  
- **Pass data** in and out of subgraphs.  
- **Reuse** subgraphs across multiple parent graphs.  
- **Handle errors** locally or let them bubble up.  
- **Leverage concurrency** within subgraphs.  

Moving forward, we’ll explore **Step 5**, which typically addresses **Agentic Patterns** in more depth—where your graphs become even more dynamic, orchestrating multiple sub-processes or agents, some of which might be powered by LLMs or advanced AI modules. You’ll see how subgraphs and concurrency come together in agentic contexts, and how you can manage complex interactions with external systems. Stay tuned for these more sophisticated use cases and design patterns that will push your LangGraph skills to the next level!

# Agentic Patterns in LangGraph

Welcome to **Step 5**! This stage is all about taking LangGraph beyond static, pre-defined flows and into the realm of **dynamic, decision-making processes**—often referred to as “agentic” patterns. In such workflows, one or more nodes (or entire subgraphs) can act like “agents,” making decisions on how the flow should continue, often powered by advanced AI models such as Large Language Models (LLMs).

In this step, we’ll explore:

1. **What “Agentic” Means** in the context of state-based graph execution.  
2. **LLM-Powered Nodes** and how to integrate them in your graph.  
3. **Dynamic Branching** where nodes decide the next step at runtime.  
4. **Memory and Context Management** for chat or iterative reasoning tasks.  
5. **Orchestrating Multiple Agents** (or subgraphs) that collaborate or compete to solve a task.  
6. **Error Handling and Guardrails** for agentic flows.  
7. **Practical Examples** to illustrate each concept.

---

## 1. What Does “Agentic” Mean in LangGraph?

In a **static** graph, the sequence of nodes is predetermined by your edges. A node might do a bit of computation, but it doesn’t fundamentally change the graph’s next steps at runtime beyond normal conditional edges.

In contrast, **agentic** graphs allow nodes to:

- **Call an external reasoning engine** (often an LLM).  
- **Interpret** the results of that reasoning.  
- **Alter** the subsequent execution path based on real-time insights.

In other words, an **agent node** can dynamically select which node(s) to run next or even generate new steps (where appropriate). This creates far more **flexibility** and can simulate a “thinking” process within your LangGraph workflows.

---

## 2. LLM-Powered Nodes

A common agentic pattern involves an **LLM node** that generates text output, which then influences the flow. For example:

1. **System**: Provide a prompt or instructions to the model.  
2. **LLM Node**: Receives the current state, including user input or context.  
3. **Model Output**: The LLM returns text that may contain an “action” or a recommended next step.

### Example: A Simple LLM Node

```python
from langgraph.core import StateGraph, Node, Edge

# We'll assume 'run_llm' is a helper that calls an LLM API
def llm_agent_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    user_input = state["user_input"]
    # You might include instructions, context, etc.
    prompt = f"Determine if input is a question or statement: {user_input}"
    llm_result = run_llm(prompt)
    
    # We'll store raw LLM output
    state["agent_output"] = llm_result
    return {"agent_raw": llm_result}

g = StateGraph(name="SimpleAgentGraph")
g.add_node(Node(name="LLMAgent", func=llm_agent_node))
g.set_start("LLMAgent")

final_state = g.invoke({"user_input": "How do I cook pasta?"})
print(final_state)
# Might contain:
# {
#   "user_input": "How do I cook pasta?",
#   "agent_output": "This is a question about cooking."
#   "agent_raw": "This is a question about cooking."
# }
```

This “LLM Node” is only half the story. Next, you’d **interpret** the model’s output—possibly with another node that decides the next step (e.g., route to a “FAQ subgraph” vs. a “generic response” node).

---

## 3. Dynamic Branching

Dynamic branching occurs when **a node itself decides** where the graph should go next. In LangGraph, you typically implement this via:

- **Conditional edges**: Edges that have guard functions, which check the state.  
- **Dynamic next-node selection**: The node returns a name or list of names for the next node(s).  

### 3.1. Conditional Edges

You can attach a `guard` function to an edge:

```python
def is_question_guard(state: dict) -> bool:
    # Simple heuristic
    return "?" in state["user_input"]

g.add_edge(
    Edge(source="LLMAgent", target="QuestionHandler", guard=is_question_guard)
)
g.add_edge(
    Edge(source="LLMAgent", target="StatementHandler", guard=lambda s: not is_question_guard(s))
)
```

When `LLMAgent` finishes, LangGraph evaluates each edge in order. If the `guard` is `True`, that path is taken. This is a **static** way to handle branching—“static” in the sense that the guard logic is code you wrote, rather than coming from the LLM.

### 3.2. LLM-Directed Next Step

In more advanced scenarios, you might let the LLM instruct which node to call next:

```python
def llm_directed_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    llm_result = state["agent_raw"]
    if "question" in llm_result.lower():
        state["next_node"] = "QuestionHandler"
    else:
        state["next_node"] = "StatementHandler"
    return {}

def dynamic_routing(state: dict) -> str:
    # This node outputs the name of the next node from state
    return state["next_node"]

g.add_node(Node(name="RoutingDecider", func=llm_directed_node))
g.add_node(Node(name="DynamicRouter", func=dynamic_routing, is_router=True))

g.add_edge(Edge(source="LLMAgent", target="RoutingDecider"))
g.add_edge(Edge(source="RoutingDecider", target="DynamicRouter"))
g.add_edge(Edge(source="DynamicRouter", target="QuestionHandler", label="question"))
g.add_edge(Edge(source="DynamicRouter", target="StatementHandler", label="statement"))
```

- `llm_directed_node` examines the LLM output (e.g., “This is a question...”) and stores the string of the next node in `state["next_node"]`.  
- `dynamic_routing` is a **routing node** that returns the exact node name to proceed to.  
- Edges from `DynamicRouter` to `QuestionHandler` or `StatementHandler` each have a label for clarity, but the actual routing decision is decided by the function’s return value.

This pattern gives you a “middle ground” between fully-coded logic vs. letting the LLM decide the route.

---

## 4. Memory and Context Management

**Agentic flows** often require *memory*—the agent needs to know what happened in previous steps, what the user said before, or internal chain-of-thought details. Because LangGraph already uses a shared state dict, the simplest approach is to store relevant context in the state:

```python
def store_conversation_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    if "conversation_history" not in state:
        state["conversation_history"] = []
    state["conversation_history"].append({"role": "user", "content": state["user_input"]})
    return {}
```

Then, your LLM node can incorporate `state["conversation_history"]` into its prompts. If you need more sophisticated memory or summary logic, you can place it in a dedicated subgraph that:

1. Appends new messages.  
2. Summarizes old messages if the history is too long.  
3. Maintains global context or user preferences.

### Self-Reflective Agents

A more advanced pattern is when an agent “self-reflects” on its own output—storing intermediate reasoning or chain-of-thought in the state before producing a final answer. This is typically done by letting your LLM node generate structured data (like JSON) that includes both final answer and “scratch notes.” You can store or ignore these notes as needed.

---

## 5. Orchestrating Multiple Agents

Sometimes you have **multiple specialized agents** that collaborate:

- **Agent A** might be specialized in retrieving data from a knowledge base.  
- **Agent B** might be specialized in summarizing or analyzing that data.  
- **Agent C** might be specialized in responding to user sentiment or tone.  

You can represent each agent as a subgraph (discussed in **Step 4**), then orchestrate them in the parent graph. For instance:

```python
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="KnowledgeSubgraph", subgraph=agentA_graph))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="AnalysisSubgraph", subgraph=agentB_graph))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="SentimentSubgraph", subgraph=agentC_graph))

parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="Start", target="KnowledgeSubgraph"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="KnowledgeSubgraph", target="AnalysisSubgraph"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="AnalysisSubgraph", target="SentimentSubgraph"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="SentimentSubgraph", target="End"))
```

Each subgraph can call different LLM endpoints or run different logic. They can also exchange partial results through the shared state. If you need concurrency, you could fan out calls to multiple agents in parallel and merge results afterward.

---

## 6. Error Handling and Guardrails

Agentic systems, especially those involving LLMs, can be prone to **hallucinations**, unexpected outputs, or even failures in API calls. Consider:

1. **Timeouts**: If your LLM call stalls, handle it with a fallback.  
2. **Validation**: If the LLM’s output is supposed to be JSON, parse and validate it. If it’s invalid, either retry or handle gracefully.  
3. **Safety Checks**: If you’re building a user-facing agent, ensure it’s not generating harmful or disallowed content.  
4. **Fallback Paths**: You can attach edges that handle “error states” or parse exceptions. For instance, if a node fails to parse LLM output as JSON, redirect to a `FallbackHandler` node.

**Pattern**:

```python
def llm_node_safe(state: dict) -> dict:
    try:
        raw_response = run_llm("...")
        parsed = json.loads(raw_response)
        state["parsed_data"] = parsed
    except Exception as e:
        state["llm_error"] = str(e)
        raise
    return {}

g.add_node(Node(name="SafeLLMNode", func=llm_node_safe))

def llm_error_guard(state: dict) -> bool:
    return "llm_error" in state

g.add_edge(
    Edge(source="SafeLLMNode", target="FallbackHandler", guard=llm_error_guard)
)
g.add_edge(
    Edge(source="SafeLLMNode", target="ContinueProcessing", guard=lambda s: "llm_error" not in s)
)
```

---

## 7. Practical Examples

Let’s look at a more **complete** scenario combining everything so far:

### 7.1. Multi-Step Reasoning Agent

**Goal**: The user asks a question that requires multiple steps: retrieval, inference, and final summarization.

1. **UserInputNode**: Collect user’s question.  
2. **MemoryNode**: Store conversation or context.  
3. **LLMPlannerNode**: The LLM decides which subgraph(s) to call:
   - If it needs data from a knowledge base, it sets `state["next_node"] = "KnowledgeSubgraphNode"`.  
   - Otherwise, it might skip retrieval and go directly to `AnalysisSubgraphNode`.  
4. **KnowledgeSubgraphNode** (agent subgraph) → performs retrieval.  
5. **AnalysisSubgraphNode** (agent subgraph) → interprets the retrieved data.  
6. **LLMSummarizerNode** → final answer.  

**Implementation Sketch**:

```python
# 1) The memory node
def memory_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    convo = state.setdefault("conversation", [])
    convo.append({"role": "user", "content": state["user_input"]})
    return {}

# 2) The LLM planner node
def llm_planner_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    # Hypothetical system prompt
    system_prompt = """You are an AI that decides the next best step..."""
    user_query = state["user_input"]
    llm_output = run_llm(f"{system_prompt}\nUser query: {user_query}")
    
    if "need knowledge base" in llm_output.lower():
        state["next_node"] = "KnowledgeSubgraphNode"
    else:
        state["next_node"] = "AnalysisSubgraphNode"
    
    return {"planner_output": llm_output}

# 3) Knowledge Subgraph (agent)
knowledge_subg = StateGraph(name="KnowledgeAgent")
# ... define retrieval logic, store in state["knowledge_data"]

# 4) Analysis Subgraph (agent)
analysis_subg = StateGraph(name="AnalysisAgent")
# ... interpret knowledge_data or user_input, store results

# 5) Summarizer node
def llm_summarize_node(state: dict) -> dict:
    analysis = state.get("analysis_result", "")
    knowledge = state.get("knowledge_data", "")
    final_prompt = f"Analysis: {analysis}\nKnowledge: {knowledge}\nSummarize answer for user."
    summary = run_llm(final_prompt)
    return {"final_answer": summary}

# 6) Putting it all together
parent_graph = StateGraph(name="AgenticParentGraph")
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="UserInput", func=lambda s: {}))  # user_input is presumably already in state
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="MemoryNode", func=memory_node))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="LLMPlannerNode", func=llm_planner_node))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="KnowledgeSubgraphNode", subgraph=knowledge_subg))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="AnalysisSubgraphNode", subgraph=analysis_subg))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="SummarizeAnswer", func=llm_summarize_node))
parent_graph.add_node(Node(name="End", func=lambda s: {}))

parent_graph.set_start("UserInput")

parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="UserInput", target="MemoryNode"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="MemoryNode", target="LLMPlannerNode"))
# A router approach:
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="LLMPlannerNode", target="KnowledgeSubgraphNode",
                           guard=lambda s: s.get("next_node") == "KnowledgeSubgraphNode"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="LLMPlannerNode", target="AnalysisSubgraphNode",
                           guard=lambda s: s.get("next_node") == "AnalysisSubgraphNode"))

# After subgraph(s), always go to Summarize
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="KnowledgeSubgraphNode", target="SummarizeAnswer"))
parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="AnalysisSubgraphNode", target="SummarizeAnswer"))

parent_graph.add_edge(Edge(source="SummarizeAnswer", target="End"))

# Run it:
initial_state = {"user_input": "What's the capital of France?"}
final_state = parent_graph.invoke(initial_state)
print(final_state.get("final_answer"))
```

In this **agentic** pipeline:

- The LLM planner decides whether it needs to consult a knowledge base.  
- If it does, execution flows through `KnowledgeSubgraphNode`. If not, it goes directly to `AnalysisSubgraphNode`.  
- Finally, everything merges into the “SummarizeAnswer” node.

You can extend this flow with concurrency, advanced memory management, or more specialized subgraphs.

---

## 8. Best Practices for Agentic Flows

1. **Keep It Modular**: Isolate complex LLM logic into subgraphs or dedicated nodes.  
2. **Use Guards and Validations**: Validate LLM outputs; don’t blindly trust them.  
3. **Checkpointing**: When dealing with multi-step reasoning, consider using checkpointing for easier debugging.  
4. **Limit Depth**: Avoid extremely deep or unbounded loops—LLMs can generate repetitive or unhelpful tasks if not constrained.  
5. **Version Your Prompts**: If you have mission-critical prompts (system messages, chain-of-thought instructions), keep them versioned to avoid breaking changes.

---

## 9. Conclusion & Next Steps

In **Step 5**, you’ve seen how to bring **agentic patterns** into your LangGraph workflows, where one or more nodes can dynamically shape the execution path. This level of flexibility is especially powerful when leveraging LLMs or other AI modules that can reason about context, plan multiple steps, and produce sophisticated outputs. 

You’ve learned how to:
- Create **LLM-powered nodes** that decide the next step.  
- Implement **dynamic branching** with conditional edges or routing nodes.  
- Manage **memory** for multi-step conversations or chain-of-thought.  
- Orchestrate **multiple specialized agents**.  
- Incorporate **error handling** and guardrails in agentic flows.

Next, in **Step 6**, we’ll shift our focus to **Advanced Node Types & Integrations**—diving deeper into hooking up external services (databases, message queues, or microservices), leveraging concurrency in real-world systems, and building robust production pipelines with logging, observability, and more sophisticated checkpointing. Stay tuned for more ways to power up your LangGraph projects and push them closer to production-grade reliability!
