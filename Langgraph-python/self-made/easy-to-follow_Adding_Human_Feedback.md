# Here's an easy to follow guide on how to add human feedback to the Langgraph process.

## Step 1: Pick Your Agents

There are a minimum of three agents required in a human feedback loop:
1. A "Display" agent that will show content to the human and collect feedback
2. A "Handler" agent that will process and use the feedback
3. A "Flow Manager" agent that controls the workflow

## Step 2: Set Up Your Feedback Point

1. In your Display agent, create a feedback collection method:
```python
async def get_feedback(self, state: dict):
    # Get what needs review from the state
    content = state.get("content_to_review")
    
    # Get human input (can be console, web interface, etc.)
    feedback = input(f"Review this: {content}\nFeedback (or 'ok' if good):\n> ")
    
    # Return standardized feedback format
    return {"feedback": None if feedback.lower() == "ok" else feedback}
```

2. In your Handler agent, add feedback processing:
```python
async def process_with_feedback(self, state: dict):
    # Check for feedback
    feedback = state.get("feedback")
    
    if feedback:
        # Modify your process based on feedback
        # Return modified state
        return {"modified": True, "result": "new_result"}
    
    # Continue normal process if no feedback
    return {"modified": False, "result": "normal_result"}
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Flow

In your Flow Manager agent, create the workflow:
```python
def create_workflow(self):
    workflow = StateGraph(YourStateType)
    
    # Add your nodes
    workflow.add_node("show", display_agent.get_feedback)
    workflow.add_node("process", handler_agent.process_with_feedback)
    
    # Basic flow
    workflow.add_edge("previous_step", "show")
    
    # Add decision point
    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "show",
        lambda x: "continue" if x["feedback"] is None else "revise",
        {
            "continue": "next_step",  # When human approves
            "revise": "process"       # When human gives feedback
        }
    )
```

## How It Works

Think of it like a review process:
1. Something is shown to the human
2. Human either:
   - Approves it → continue to next step
   - Gives feedback → goes to handler for changes
3. If changes were made, can loop back for another review

## Example Use Cases

You can add human feedback at any point where you need human oversight:
- Reviewing plans or outlines
- Checking generated content
- Validating results
- Making strategic decisions

## Tips for Implementation

1. **State Management**
   - Keep feedback in a consistent format
   - Make sure state includes all needed context

2. **Feedback Collection**
   - Make prompts clear and specific
   - Provide format instructions
   - Handle different input methods (console/web/etc)

3. **Flow Control**
   - Consider how many review cycles to allow
   - Plan for timeout or skip scenarios
   - Think about parallel vs sequential reviews
