# How to handle large numbers of tools¶

Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

  * Tools 
  * Chat Models 
  * Embedding Models 
  * Vectorstores 
  * Document 

The subset of available tools to call is generally at the discretion of the
model (although many providers also enable the user to specify or constrain
the choice of tool). As the number of available tools grows, you may want to
limit the scope of the LLM's selection, to decrease token consumption and to
help manage sources of error in LLM reasoning.

Here we will demonstrate how to dynamically adjust the tools available to a
model. Bottom line up front: like RAG and similar methods, we prefix the model
invocation by retrieving over available tools. Although we demonstrate one
implementation that searches over tool descriptions, the details of the tool
selection can be customized as needed.

## Setup¶

First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys

    
    
    %%capture --no-stderr
    %pip install --quiet -U langgraph langchain_openai numpy
    
    
    
    import getpass
    import os
    
    
    def _set_env(var: str):
        if not os.environ.get(var):
            os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")
    
    
    _set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

## Define the tools¶

Let's consider a toy example in which we have one tool for each publicly
traded company in the S&P 500 index. Each tool fetches company-specific
information based on the year provided as a parameter.

We first construct a registry that associates a unique identifier with a
schema for each tool. We will represent the tools using JSON schema, which can
be bound directly to chat models supporting tool calling.

    
    
    import re
    import uuid
    
    from langchain_core.tools import StructuredTool
    
    
    def create_tool(company: str) -> dict:
        """Create schema for a placeholder tool."""
        # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and replace spaces with underscores for the tool name
        formatted_company = re.sub(r"[^\w\s]", "", company).replace(" ", "_")
    
        def company_tool(year: int) -> str:
            # Placeholder function returning static revenue information for the company and year
            return f"{company} had revenues of $100 in {year}."
    
        return StructuredTool.from_function(
            company_tool,
            name=formatted_company,
            description=f"Information about {company}",
        )
    
    
    # Abbreviated list of S&P 500 companies for demonstration
    s_and_p_500_companies = [
        "3M",
        "A.O. Smith",
        "Abbott",
        "Accenture",
        "Advanced Micro Devices",
        "Yum! Brands",
        "Zebra Technologies",
        "Zimmer Biomet",
        "Zoetis",
    ]
    
    # Create a tool for each company and store it in a registry with a unique UUID as the key
    tool_registry = {
        str(uuid.uuid4()): create_tool(company) for company in s_and_p_500_companies
    }
    

API Reference: StructuredTool

## Define the graph¶

### Tool selection¶

We will construct a node that retrieves a subset of available tools given the
information in the state-- such as a recent user message. In general, the full
scope of retrieval solutions are available for this step. As a simple
solution, we index embeddings of tool descriptions in a vector store, and
associate user queries to tools via semantic search.

    
    
    from langchain_core.documents import Document
    from langchain_core.vectorstores import InMemoryVectorStore
    from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
    
    tool_documents = [
        Document(
            page_content=tool.description,
            id=id,
            metadata={"tool_name": tool.name},
        )
        for id, tool in tool_registry.items()
    ]
    
    vector_store = InMemoryVectorStore(embedding=OpenAIEmbeddings())
    document_ids = vector_store.add_documents(tool_documents)
    

API Reference: Document | InMemoryVectorStore | OpenAIEmbeddings

### Incorporating with an agent¶

We will use a typical React agent graph (e.g., as used in the quickstart),
with some modifications:

  * We add a `selected_tools` key to the state, which stores our selected subset of tools;
  * We set the entry point of the graph to be a `select_tools` node, which populates this element of the state;
  * We bind the selected subset of tools to the chat model within the `agent` node.

## Repeating tool selection¶

To manage errors from incorrect tool selection, we could revisit the
`select_tools` node. One option for implementing this is to modify
`select_tools` to generate the vector store query using all messages in the
state (e.g., with a chat model) and add an edge routing from `tools` to
`select_tools`.

We implement this change below. For demonstration purposes, we simulate an
error in the initial tool selection by adding a `hack_remove_tool_condition`
to the `select_tools` node, which removes the correct tool on the first
iteration of the node. Note that on the second iteration, the agent finishes
the run as it has access to the correct tool.

Using Pydantic with LangChain

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 `BaseModel`, which requires `langchain-core >=
0.3`. Using `langchain-core < 0.3` will result in errors due to mixing of
Pydantic v1 and v2 `BaseModels`.

## Next steps¶

This guide provides a minimal implementation for dynamically selecting tools.
There is a host of possible improvements and optimizations:

  * **Repeating tool selection** : Here, we repeated tool selection by modifying the `select_tools` node. Another option is to equip the agent with a `reselect_tools` tool, allowing it to re-select tools at its discretion.
  * **Optimizing tool selection** : In general, the full scope of retrieval solutions are available for tool selection. Additional options include:
  * Group tools and retrieve over groups;
  * Use a chat model to select tools or groups of tool.
