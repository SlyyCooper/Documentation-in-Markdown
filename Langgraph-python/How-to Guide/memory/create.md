# How to add memory to the prebuilt ReAct agentÂ¶

Prerequisites

This guide assumes familiarity with the following:

  * LangGraph Persistence 
  * Checkpointer interface 
  * Agent Architectures 
  * Chat Models 
  * Tools 

This guide will show how to add memory to the prebuilt ReAct agent. Please see
this tutorial for how to get started with the prebuilt ReAct agent

We can add memory to the agent, by passing a checkpointer to the
create_react_agent function.

## SetupÂ¶

First, let's install the required packages and set our API keys

    
    
    %%capture --no-stderr
    %pip install -U langgraph langchain-openai
    
    
    
    import getpass
    import os
    
    
    def _set_env(var: str):
        if not os.environ.get(var):
            os.environ[var] = getpass.getpass(f"{var}: ")
    
    
    _set_env("OPENAI_API_KEY")

## CodeÂ¶

    
    
    # First we initialize the model we want to use.
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
    
    model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)
    
    
    # For this tutorial we will use custom tool that returns pre-defined values for weather in two cities (NYC & SF)
    
    from typing import Literal
    
    from langchain_core.tools import tool
    
    
    @tool
    def get_weather(city: Literal["nyc", "sf"]):
        """Use this to get weather information."""
        if city == "nyc":
            return "It might be cloudy in nyc"
        elif city == "sf":
            return "It's always sunny in sf"
        else:
            raise AssertionError("Unknown city")
    
    
    tools = [get_weather]
    
    # We can add "chat memory" to the graph with LangGraph's checkpointer
    # to retain the chat context between interactions
    from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
    
    memory = MemorySaver()
    
    # Define the graph
    
    from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
    
    graph = create_react_agent(model, tools=tools, checkpointer=memory)
    

API Reference: ChatOpenAI | tool | MemorySaver | create_react_agent

## UsageÂ¶

Let's interact with it multiple times to show that it can remember

    
    
    def print_stream(stream):
        for s in stream:
            message = s["messages"][-1]
            if isinstance(message, tuple):
                print(message)
            else:
                message.pretty_print()
    
    
    
    config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
    inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's the weather in NYC?")]}
    
    print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values"))
    
    
    
    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    What's the weather in NYC?
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    Tool Calls:
      get_weather (call_xM1suIq26KXvRFqJIvLVGfqG)
     Call ID: call_xM1suIq26KXvRFqJIvLVGfqG
      Args:
        city: nyc
    =================================[1m Tool Message [0m=================================
    Name: get_weather
    
    It might be cloudy in nyc
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
    
    The weather in NYC might be cloudy.
    

Notice that when we pass the same the same thread ID, the chat history is
preserved

    
    
    inputs = {"messages": [("user", "What's it known for?")]}
    print_stream(graph.stream(inputs, config=config, stream_mode="values"))
    
    
    
    ================================[1m Human Message [0m=================================
    
    What's it known for?
    ==================================[1m Ai Message [0m==================================
