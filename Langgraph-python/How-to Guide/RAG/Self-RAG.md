Self-RAG¶
Self-RAG is a strategy for RAG that incorporates self-reflection / self-grading on retrieved documents and generations.

In the paper, a few decisions are made:

Should I retrieve from retriever, R -

Input: x (question) OR x (question), y (generation)

Decides when to retrieve D chunks with R
Output: yes, no, continue

Are the retrieved passages D relevant to the question x -

Input: (x (question), d (chunk)) for d in D
d provides useful information to solve x
Output: relevant, irrelevant

Are the LLM generation from each chunk in D is relevant to the chunk (hallucinations, etc) -

Input: x (question), d (chunk), y (generation) for d in D

All of the verification-worthy statements in y (generation) are supported by d
Output: {fully supported, partially supported, no support

The LLM generation from each chunk in D is a useful response to x (question) -

Input: x (question), y (generation) for d in D

y (generation) is a useful response to x (question).
Output: {5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
We will implement some of these ideas from scratch using LangGraph.

Setup¶
First let's install our required packages and set our API keys


! pip install -U langchain_community tiktoken langchain-openai langchainhub chromadb langchain langgraph

import getpass

def _set_env(key: str):
    if key not in os.environ:

LLMs¶
Using Pydantic with LangChain

This notebook uses Pydantic v2 BaseModel, which requires langchain-core >= 0.3. Using langchain-core < 0.3 will result in errors due to mixing of Pydantic v1 and v2 BaseModels.


### Retrieval Grader


from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field


# Data model
class GradeDocuments(BaseModel):
    """Binary score for relevance check on retrieved documents."""

    binary_score: str = Field(
        description="Documents are relevant to the question, 'yes' or 'no'"
    )


# LLM with function call
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)
structured_llm_grader = llm.with_structured_output(GradeDocuments)

# Prompt
system = """You are a grader assessing relevance of a retrieved document to a user question. \n 
    It does not need to be a stringent test. The goal is to filter out erroneous retrievals. \n
    If the document contains keyword(s) or semantic meaning related to the user question, grade it as relevant. \n
    Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no' score to indicate whether the document is relevant to the question."""
grade_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "Retrieved document: \n\n {document} \n\n User question: {question}"),
    ]
)

doc_txt = docs[1].page_content

### Generate

from langchain import hub
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser

# Prompt
prompt = hub.pull("rlm/rag-prompt")

# LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0)


# Post-processing

# Chain
rag_chain = prompt | llm | StrOutputParser()

# Run
generation = rag_chain.invoke({"context": docs, "question": question})
print(generation)
API Reference: StrOutputParser


The design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning, and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience. Memory stream is a long-term memory module that records a comprehensive list of agents' experience in natural language. LLM functions as the agent's brain in an autonomous agent system.

### Hallucination Grader


# Data model
class GradeHallucinations(BaseModel):
    """Binary score for hallucination present in generation answer."""

    binary_score: str = Field(
        description="Answer is grounded in the facts, 'yes' or 'no'"

# Prompt
system = """You are a grader assessing whether an LLM generation is grounded in / supported by a set of retrieved facts. \n 
     Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no'. 'Yes' means that the answer is grounded in / supported by the set of facts."""
hallucination_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "Set of facts: \n\n {documents} \n\n LLM generation: {generation}"),
    ]
)

hallucination_grader = hallucination_prompt | structured_llm_grader
hallucination_grader.invoke({"documents": docs, "generation": generation})

GradeHallucinations(binary_score='yes')

### Answer Grader


# Data model
class GradeAnswer(BaseModel):
    """Binary score to assess answer addresses question."""

    binary_score: str = Field(
        description="Answer addresses the question, 'yes' or 'no'"
    )


# LLM with function call
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)
structured_llm_grader = llm.with_structured_output(GradeAnswer)

# Prompt
system = """You are a grader assessing whether an answer addresses / resolves a question \n 
     Give a binary score 'yes' or 'no'. Yes' means that the answer resolves the question."""
answer_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        ("human", "User question: \n\n {question} \n\n LLM generation: {generation}"),
    ]
)

answer_grader = answer_prompt | structured_llm_grader
answer_grader.invoke({"question": question, "generation": generation})

GradeAnswer(binary_score='yes')

### Question Re-writer

# LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-0125", temperature=0)

# Prompt
system = """You a question re-writer that converts an input question to a better version that is optimized \n 
     for vectorstore retrieval. Look at the input and try to reason about the underlying semantic intent / meaning."""
re_write_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        ("system", system),
        (
            "human",
            "Here is the initial question: \n\n {question} \n Formulate an improved question.",
        ),
