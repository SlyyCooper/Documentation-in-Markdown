 BaseChannel
Bases: Generic[Value, Update, C], ABC

 ValueType: Any abstractmethod property
The type of the value stored in the channel.

 UpdateType: Any abstractmethod property
The type of the update received by the channel.

 checkpoint() -> Optional[C]
Return a serializable representation of the channel's current state. Raises EmptyChannelError if the channel is empty (never updated yet), or doesn't support checkpoints.

 from_checkpoint(checkpoint: Optional[C]) -> Self abstractmethod
Return a new identical channel, optionally initialized from a checkpoint. If the checkpoint contains complex data structures, they should be copied.

 update(values: Sequence[Update]) -> bool abstractmethod
Update the channel's value with the given sequence of updates. The order of the updates in the sequence is arbitrary. This method is called by Pregel for all channels at the end of each step. If there are no updates, it is called with an empty sequence. Raises InvalidUpdateError if the sequence of updates is invalid. Returns True if the channel was updated, False otherwise.

 get() -> Value abstractmethod
Return the current value of the channel.

Raises EmptyChannelError if the channel is empty (never updated yet).

 consume() -> bool
Mark the current value of the channel as consumed. By default, no-op. This is called by Pregel before the start of the next step, for all channels that triggered a node. If the channel was updated, return True.

 Topic
Bases: Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Sequence[Value], Union[Value, list[Value]], tuple[set[Value], list[Value]]]

A configurable PubSub Topic.

Parameters:

typ (Type[Value]) – The type of the value stored in the channel.
accumulate (bool, default: False ) – Whether to accumulate values across steps. If False, the channel will be emptied after each step.
 ValueType: Any property
The type of the value stored in the channel.

 UpdateType: Any property
The type of the update received by the channel.

 consume() -> bool
Mark the current value of the channel as consumed. By default, no-op. This is called by Pregel before the start of the next step, for all channels that triggered a node. If the channel was updated, return True.

 LastValue
Bases: Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Value, Value, Value]

Stores the last value received, can receive at most one value per step.

 ValueType: Type[Value] property
The type of the value stored in the channel.

 UpdateType: Type[Value] property
The type of the update received by the channel.

 checkpoint() -> Optional[C]
Return a serializable representation of the channel's current state. Raises EmptyChannelError if the channel is empty (never updated yet), or doesn't support checkpoints.

 consume() -> bool
Mark the current value of the channel as consumed. By default, no-op. This is called by Pregel before the start of the next step, for all channels that triggered a node. If the channel was updated, return True.

 EphemeralValue
Bases: Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Value, Value, Value]

Stores the value received in the step immediately preceding, clears after.

 ValueType: Type[Value] property
The type of the value stored in the channel.

 UpdateType: Type[Value] property
The type of the update received by the channel.

 checkpoint() -> Optional[C]
Return a serializable representation of the channel's current state. Raises EmptyChannelError if the channel is empty (never updated yet), or doesn't support checkpoints.

 consume() -> bool
Mark the current value of the channel as consumed. By default, no-op. This is called by Pregel before the start of the next step, for all channels that triggered a node. If the channel was updated, return True.

 BinaryOperatorAggregate
Bases: Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Value, Value, Value]

Stores the result of applying a binary operator to the current value and each new value.


import operator

total = Channels.BinaryOperatorAggregate(int, operator.add)
 ValueType: Type[Value] property
The type of the value stored in the channel.

 UpdateType: Type[Value] property
The type of the update received by the channel.

 checkpoint() -> Optional[C]
Return a serializable representation of the channel's current state. Raises EmptyChannelError if the channel is empty (never updated yet), or doesn't support checkpoints.

 consume() -> bool
Mark the current value of the channel as consumed. By default, no-op. This is called by Pregel before the start of the next step, for all channels that triggered a node. If the channel was updated, return True.

 AnyValue
Bases: Generic[Value], BaseChannel[Value, Value, Value]

Stores the last value received, assumes that if multiple values are received, they are all equal.

 ValueType: Type[Value] property
The type of the value stored in the channel.

 UpdateType: Type[Value] property
The type of the update received by the channel.

 checkpoint() -> Optional[C]
Return a serializable representation of the channel's current state. Raises EmptyChannelError if the channel is empty (never updated yet), or doesn't support checkpoints.

 consume() -> bool
Mark the current value of the channel as consumed. By default, no-op. This is called by Pregel before the start of the next step, for all channels that triggered a node. If the channel was updated, return True.
